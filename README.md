The early detection of lung cancer is crucial for improving patient survival rates. Traditional diagnostic methods, while effective, often come with limitations such as invasiveness, high costs, and variable accuracy. This project introduces a novel approach for the early detection of lung cancer, leveraging a stacking ensemble-based methodology applied to computed tomography (CT) scans. Our approach combines multiple machine learning models, including deep learning and traditional algorithms, to capitalize on their individual strengths and mitigate their weaknesses. The ensemble model aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy, reduce false positives, and offer a non-invasive, efficient alternative to traditional methods.

The methodology encompasses data collection, rigorous preprocessing to enhance image quality, feature extraction to identify relevant characteristics, and the training of individual models. These models' predictions are then combined into a meta-dataset, which trains a meta-classifier to produce the final diagnostic output. This method ensures a comprehensive analysis by considering various aspects of the CT images and leveraging the collective intelligence of diverse algorithms.

Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC underscore the model's effectiveness, indicating its potential as a valuable tool in lung cancer diagnostics. Moreover, the project explores the integration of the model into clinical workflows, addressing the practical aspects of deployment in healthcare settings.

Future enhancements focus on expanding data modalities, implementing explainable AI to increase transparency, real-time processing capabilities, leveraging larger and more diverse datasets for better generalization, continuous learning mechanisms for model updating, and initiating clinical trials to validate effectiveness in real-world scenarios. This project signifies a step forward in the application of machine learning for lung cancer detection, aiming to contribute significantly to early diagnostics and, consequently, improved patient outcomes.
